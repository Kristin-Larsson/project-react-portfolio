# React Portfolio
Week 9 at technigo bootcamp.
This weeks project was to remake my portfolio to make it in React with reusable components.

## The problem
I have based the structure of this project on the sections that my portfolio is built on. Each section has 2 components- 1 with html and functions and 1 with styling.
For the main styling- text, wrapper, sections, title I have a component called main.

When I found a good structure I think this was a nice way to build the portfolio and a good way to learn components and reusable components. 

If I had more time I would 
-look through my code again and see where I could remove a styled component and reuse a component that already exists.
-Check the styling and go through wrapper, margin, center
-Add article
-Change size of other projects container.
-Add hover effect over all links.
