# React Portfolio
Week 9 at technigo bootcamp.
This weeks project was to remake my portfolio to make it in React with reusable components.

## The problem
When I found a good structure I really liked this project. I understand the purpose of reusable components and it feels like a great way to work.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
